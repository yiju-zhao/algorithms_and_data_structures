    "# Tree Traversals problem often involves visiting all nodes of a tree in a specific order. There are three main types of tree traversals: inorder, preorder, and postorder. We could use recursion to implement these traversals, but it is not efficient for large trees. Nomarlly, the recursive approach can be implemented using a stack or a queue. We also can traverse a tree horizontally by using a level-order traversal. The former is depth-first traversal, while the latter is breadth-first traversal. For example, problem one can be solved using BFS method and problem two can be solved using DFS method."
